# What Does Cross-Browser Mean?
Cross-browser refers to the ability of a website, HTML construct, application or even client-side script to work in several different environments, ones that provide its required features. Similar to the way a cross-platform program is one that can run across multiple computer platforms, cross-browser websites are capable of running in several browsers.


### 
Different web browsers are known to interpret JavaScript and HTML in different ways. For example, Apple Safari and Internet Explorer make use of different rendering engines for HTML. Therefore, the same webpage can appear with different formatting in these browsers. So, it is necessary that developers design their sites in order for them to work across several browsers.
