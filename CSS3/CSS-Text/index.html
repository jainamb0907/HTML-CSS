  Hello world
  <h1>Example text-align: justify</h1>

  <p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and
    magazines).</p>

    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever
    since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world
    haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
  </div>

  <h2>text-align-last: right:</h2>
  <p class="a">However, sticking rigidly to this formula is not always advisable. Even though the length of a paragraph
    is supposed to be determined by the topic, writers have learned to divide long texts into bite-sized paragraphs to
    avoid presenting too much text in one chunk. This is a justifiable technique that ensures readers are not
    over-faced. If you employ this technique, look for a natural break in your long paragraph. In other words, do not
    create the divide between two closely linked sentences, and avoid using pronouns in the second half that refer
    unclearly or ambiguously to nouns in the first half (called their antecedents).</p>
